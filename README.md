# JAVA_CONSOLE_APP
This is my official repository for Assignment 1 of the Further Programming (COSC2440) course, which will be a Student Enrollment Management System written in the Java language!
Just for the sake of ownership, I am going to name my program as "Java Enrollment Management System" or J.E.M.S for short.
